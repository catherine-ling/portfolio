## 📈 Regression & Statistical Modeling

> Academic and applied projects using statistical models to explore, predict, and explain trends.

### AI Text Classifier Bias Detection  
Analyzed outputs from multiple GPT detectors to uncover algorithmic bias against non-native English speakers. Applied binomial logistic regression and statistical visualization in R to quantify disparities in misclassification rates. Significant detector-specific biases were identified, with native speakers up to 19x more likely to be classified correctly over non-native speakers.
- **Tools**: R, RStudio
- **Methods**: Logistic regression, statistical bias analysis, hypothesis testing, data visualization
- **Highlight**: Identified significant classification disparities and visualized model bias across demographics.
